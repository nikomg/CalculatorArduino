# CalculatorArduino
This is My first project on arduino

## About project
This project is VEERY simple, because in qaruantinue i cant buy normal parts for project.
And I donâ€™t even have a button
But i already do order on AliExpress and soon I will have components to continue: 
buttons and a screen. 
Yes, now info is displayed in the port monitor ...
Okay, and now about project:
When you rotate one of encoders you change first or second number. And on display you see a result of summ.
Everything is very simple, but generally cool.
