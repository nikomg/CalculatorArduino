# CalculatorArduino

This is My first project on arduino

## About project
This project is VEERY simple, because on quarantine i cant buy normal parts for project.<br>
And I donâ€™t even have a button.<br>
But i already do order on AliExpress and soon I will have components to continue: <br>
buttons and a screen. <br>
Yes, now info is displayed in the port monitor ...<br>
Okay, and now about project:<br>
When you rotate one of encoders you change first or second number. And on display you see a result of summ.<br>
Everything is very simple, but generally cool.<br>
# Update 1.1V 
You can change char with potentiometer, and int num now is float. <br>
In future i add button for change a step of encoder.
